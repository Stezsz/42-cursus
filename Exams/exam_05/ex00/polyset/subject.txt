Assignment name: Polyset
Expected files: searchable_array_bag.cpp, searchable_array_bag.hpp, 
searchable_tree_bag.cpp, searchable_tree_bag.hpp, set.cpp, set.hpp
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will find in this directory some classes:
- bag: an abstract class representing a bag.
- searchable_bag: an abstract class representing a bag with the ability to 
	search within it.
- array_bag: an implementation of a bag using an array as the underlying data 
	structure.
- tree_bag: an implementation of a bag using a binary search tree as the underlying 
data structure.

If you don't know what is a set or a bag (shame!) you can read the attached
file shame.en.txt

First part:
Since a bag without a searching function isn't very useful, implement two 
classes, searchable_array_bag and searchable_tree_bag, that will inherit from 
array_bag and tree_bag, respectivelly, and implement the searchable_bag abstract class.

Second part:
Implement the class set that will wrap a searchable_bag and turn it into a set.
In this directory you will find a main file that must compile with your code.
All your classes should follow the orthodox canonical form. Don't forget the consts.
